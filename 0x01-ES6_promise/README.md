# 0x01. ES6 Promises

Tasks
0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep

Return a Promise using this prototype function getResponseFromAPI()

1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
mandatory
Using the prototype below, return a promise. The parameter is a boolean.

2. Catch me if you can!
mandatory
Using the function prototype below

3. Handle multiple successful promises
mandatory
In this file, import uploadPhoto and createUser from utils.js

Knowing that the functions in utils.js return promises, use the prototype below to collectively resolve all promises and log body firstName lastName to the console.


4. Simple promise
mandatory
Using the following prototype

function signUpUser(firstName, lastName) {
}
That returns a resolved promise with this object:

{
  firstName: value,
  lastName: value,
}

5. Reject the promises
mandatory
Write and export a function named uploadPhoto. It should accept one argument fileName (string).

The function should return a Promise rejecting with an Error and the string $fileName cannot be processed

export default function uploadPhoto(filename) {

}

6. Handle multiple promises
mandatory
Import signUpUser from 4-user-promise.js and uploadPhoto from 5-photo-reject.js.

Write and export a function named handleProfileSignup. It should accept three arguments firstName (string), lastName (string), and fileName (string). The function should call the two other functions. When the promises are all settled it should return an array with the following structure:

[

7. Load balancer
mandatory
Write and export a function named loadBalancer. It should accept two arguments chinaDownload (Promise) and USDownload (Promise).

The function should return the value returned by the promise that resolved the first.

export default function loadBalancer(chinaDownload, USDownload) {

}

8. Throw error / try catch
mandatory
Write a function named divideFunction that will accept two arguments: numerator (Number) and denominator (Number).

When the denominator argument is equal to 0, the function should throw a new error with the message cannot divide by 0. Otherwise it should return the numerator divided by the denominator.

export default function divideFunction(numerator, denominator) {

}

9. Throw an error
mandatory
Write a function named guardrail that will accept one argument mathFunction (Function).

This function should create and return an array named queue.

When the mathFunction function is executed, the value returned by the function should be appended to the queue. If this function throws an error, the error message should be appended to the queue. In every case, the message Guardrail was processed should be added to the queue.

Example:

[
  1000,
  'Guardrail was processed',
]

10. Await / Async
#advanced
Import uploadPhoto and createUser from utils.js

Write an async function named asyncUploadUser that will call these two functions and return an object with the following format:

{
  photo: response_from_uploadPhoto_function,
  user: response_from_createUser_function,
}
If one of the async function fails, return an empty object. Example:

{
  photo: null,
  user: null,
}
